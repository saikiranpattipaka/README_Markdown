# README_Markdown

### This file gives information about how to edit README.md file with different fonts and styles

## 1. Headers and Subheaders

You can create multiple levels of headers, allowing you to structure the document into sections:


`#` Main Header (Level 1)

`##` Subheader (Level 2)
 
`###` Sub-subheader (Level 3)

`####` Further subheading (Level 4)

`#####` Even more (Level 5)

`######` The smallest (Level 6)

# 2. Bold, Italics, and Strikethrough

You can emphasize text by making it bold, italicized, or crossed out.

Bold: **Bold Text** or __Bold Text__
Italic: *Italic Text* or _Italic Text_
Strikethrough: ~~Strikethrough Text~~

**Bold Text**
*Italicized Text*
~~Strikethrough Text~~

# 3. Lists
Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered List (bullets):
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
Ordered List (numbered):
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
You can also nest lists within each other:
- Main item
  - Subitem
    - Subsubitem

# 4. Links and Images
Links and images are essential for interactivity and better user experience.

Link: [Link Text](URL)

[Google](https://www.google.com)

Image: ![Alt text](Image URL)

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

# 5. Code Blocks
To display code in your README file, you can use inline code or code blocks.

Inline code: Use backticks for small bits of code like npm start.

Use the command `npm install` to install dependencies.
Multiline code blocks: Triple backticks or indented code for multiple lines:

git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
npm install
npm start

You can specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., bash, python, javascript).

# 6. Tables
You can use tables to display structured data, like lists of features or version history.

| Feature        | Description                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature 1      | This is a description of feature 1 |
| Feature 2      | Another feature description    |

# 7. Blockquotes
Blockquotes are great for including quotes or important messages.

> "This is a blockquote."


# 8. Horizontal Line
A horizontal line is created by three dashes, asterisks, or underscores:

---
Or:

***

# 9. Badges
Badges can help display important project information, such as build status, license, or version number.

Example of a build status badge:

# 10. Footnotes
Footnotes allow you to add more detailed notes or references:

Here is a footnote reference[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote text.


# 11. Tables of Contents (TOC)
For large README files, you can include a table of contents for easy navigation. GitHub renders TOCs automatically if you use headers and link to them using anchor links (e.g., #installation for a header titled "Installation").

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

# 12. Task Lists
If you want to list things that can be checked off, you can use task lists:

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
